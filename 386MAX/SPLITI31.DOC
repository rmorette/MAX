Split QMAX_I31.ASM again

Fix file entry:

* Split QMAX_I31.ASM again

 Description:
 	To work around limitations of the feeble MASM, once again more code
	from QMAX_I31.ASM is split off into a new module (QMAX_O31.ASM).
	This should have no effect on the final product (386MAX.SYS).
 Who: HENRY
 When: 27 Dec 95.
 SW/HW Environment: All.
 Symptom: Build fails with odd errors.  Restarting does no good.
 	Problem is worse when running top-level makefile or in low memory
	conditions.
 Temporary Workaround: Exit to DOS, run nmake /n @..\max.mrf >foo.bat
 	then execute foo.bat.  This doesn't work perfectly as errors won't
	cause the batch file to terminate.
 Test Procedure: Run GET DEL BUILD on the QA build machine.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Qualitas MAX 8.01.002

New files:

QMAX_O31.ASM
	More code and data split off from QMAX_I31.ASM.  It seems the
	real choke point for QMAX_I31.ASM is the INT31 procedure and
	is caused by certain macros.

	I can't think of any exception to "this is just stuff moved
	out of QMAX_I31.ASM"  Things to watch out for should be in the
	overall layout.

	There's probably some needless externs; I did apply some effort
	to eliminating many of them, but there are probably others I
	missed.

Files affected:

MAKEFILE
	Add new module.

QMAX_I31.ASM
	Move code and data into new module QMAX_O31.ASM.
	Add some externs for newly relocated stuff.
	Make @ENVLEN public so we can use it as extern:abs

VERSBETA.ASM
	Bump version to 2.
