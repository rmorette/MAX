Avoid Extra ROM Swap If PnP In Effect

If we're emulating PnP functions, we can mistakenly add an extra ROM
entry for the PnP struc if there's an existing ROM entry.  This TWT
introduces code which check for that.

QMAX_TIM.ASM	In CACHE_PnP, check to see if the PnP struc overlaps
		  an existing ROM entry.  If so, don't add the PnP
		  struc as an additional swapped ROM entry.
