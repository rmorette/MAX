Fix Bug When Run On Cyrix 686 w/CPUID But No CR4

In our routine which checks for the CPUID instruction, we read CR4 to
see if debugging extensions are enabled rather than testing the
feature flags to see if it's supported.  Because the Cyrix 686
supports CPUID, but not CR4, we halt with an Invalid Opcode
Exception.

QMAX_INI.ASM	In CHECK_CPUID, test CPUFET_FLAG, rather than CR4.
