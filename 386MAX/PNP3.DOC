Fix Bug In PnP BIOS Support

If all of the following occur

1.  We detect a PnP BIOS, and
2.  the signature struc overlaps an existing ROM entry, and
3.  the ROM entry it overlaps is fast enough that it doesn't get
    swapped,

then, we mark it as to be swapped (because we need to patch the PnP
signature struc), but don't add in the ROM length to MAPSIZE.  The
effect of that omission is that we don't allocate extended memory for
the swapped ROM and overwrite something else.

At the same time, I fixed a bug in the ROM testing algorithm where we
were copying ROMs to low DOS memory even if we weren't swapping them.
This means we would take up more low DOS memory during initialization
than necessary, a critical resource with Win95 and DriveSpace.

QMAX_MAP.INC	Change MAP_STR flags to record format.

QMAX_TIM.ASM	Avoid copying ROMs to low DOS memory if we're not
		  swapping them.
		If we find an existing ROM overlaps the PnP signature,
		  but isn't marked as swappable, add in its size to
		  MAPSIZE and copy it to low DOS memory.
