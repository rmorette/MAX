Fix Bug In PnP Emulation

In the original implementation of our PnP support, I mistakenly
emulated functions 42h and 43h (Get/Set ESCD Data) as passing data in
the format of Far, Far, Selector whereas the correct format is Far,
Selector.  This TWT fixes that.

QMAX_EM2.ASM	Change emulation of GET_ESCD and SET_ESCD from Far,
		  far, selector to Far, selector.
