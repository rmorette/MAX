Increase EMS Shared Memory Limit

As we run into more and more systems with more than 32MB, customers
are confused by the 386UTIL (and our initialization screen) display of
Shared Memory which is limited to 32MB.  In practice, we not so
limited, but that value is actually the available EMS size.  The
simplest approach to fix this is to change the maximum amount of EMS
memory we manage.

QMAX_SIZ.ASM	Change maximum EMS memory we manage to 256MB.
