Fix Interrupt Bug

Although our INT 21h handler should be able to assume that it's called
with interrupts disabled, we all know that that's not the real world.
Alas, we have been bitten by this problem again and need to take on
additional body armor.

At the same time, I deleted some old code which supported 386MAX
LOADHIGH and LOADLOW which we no longer use, thus lessening our high
DOS memory footprint by about 60 bytes.

QMAX_OVR.ASM	In EXT_MACFNS, ensure IF=0 before saving SS/SP.
		In CHECK_ROOM, delete code to support 386MAX
		   LOADHIGH/LOADLOW.
