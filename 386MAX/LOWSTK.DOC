Fix Bug Using Too Much Low DOS Stck

During initialization, depending upon timer ticks and other such
events, we can use too much low DOS stack (which we like to keep
limited so as to reduce our low DOS memory footprint).	Among other
problems this generates is the fact that the name of our Windows VxD
is overwritten, triggering the message "Qualitas MAX VxD not found".

Because the low DOS stack (and the data below it) doesn't change over
the PM initialization code, we can refresh it from the pristine copy
in extended memory.
