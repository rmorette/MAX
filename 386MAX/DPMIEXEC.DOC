Fix DPMI Bug With DOS EXEC Calls

As a customer has pointed out, when we EXEC a program from a DPMI
client, we leave around three small data areas in low DOS (for a total
of about 160 bytes) which aren't freed until the DPMI cient
terminates.  This change fixes that.

The data areas we allocate and don't free when the DOS EXEC call
terminates are for the command line, and the two FCBs.	In a manner
similar to that used to save and restore the environment in the same
DOS EXEC sequence, we save the segments we allocate on the stack and
free them upon termination.

QMAX_D21.ASM	Move label for EXEC_LEFIX_ERR to precede the call to
		  DOSFN EXEC_LETERM so if we fail in EXEC_LEFIX, we
		  clean up the stack properly.
		In DOSFN_EXEC_LEFIX, save on the PL0 stack the
		  segments of the data areas we allocate to free later
		  on.
		In DOSFN_EXEC_LEFIX, delete the code which frees the
		  allocated data areas as that's now done in
		  DOSFN_EXEC_LETERM.
		In DOSFN_EXEC_LETERM, free the allocated data areas.
