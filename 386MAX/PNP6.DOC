Skip Using PnP RM Data Segment in First Megabyte If >= E000

On some PnP BIOS systems (such as Gateways with an AMI BIOS) the PnP
RM data segment is at ED00.  With a simple change to an equate, the
previous code will create additional PTEs for the PnP BIOS in extended
memory such that the RM data segment is addressible from PM as
extended memory rather than memory in the first megabyte.

Everything else just follows from the equate change because I had
previously encountered PnP BIOSes with a RM data segment at F000 and
took care to allow that to be addressed from PM in extended memory
(because the BIOS code was already there).

This means that the data block (on the systems I've tested it's marked
as a 4KB ROM at ED00) can be overwritten with a USE= statement.  I
have not as yet verified that that region isn't used for anything
else, so we'll have to wait for a later TWT before automatically
inserting a USE= statement.
