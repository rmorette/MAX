Workaround BIOS Bug When Rebooting

On certain systems, the BIOS doesn't handle a warm boot well -- in
fact, it locks up the system.  Once again, we try to accommodate such
systems.  This time, I'm changing the reboot method from an 8042 reset
to a jump to the reboot location preceded by clearing  the TLB and
entering RM.

The previous method can be restored via DEBUG=8042.  DEBUG=TRIP is
another choice.

386MAX		Document the new keyword.

QMAX_DB3.INC	Define new bit for old warm boot method.

QMAX_ARG.ASM	Define parse table entry for new keyword.

QMAX_EM2.ASM	Define new method of handling warm boot, leaving the
		  previous methods intact.

QMAX_FCN.ASM	Define routine to handle new keyword.
