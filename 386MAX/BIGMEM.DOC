Fix Bug With Large Memory Systems

When running 386MAX on a system with 66 Mb or more of EMS memory to
manage (the actual amount of extended memory is larger), then the I/O
ports we set aside for EMS 3.0 compatibility can overlap the reserved
I/O ports we use for internal communications between VM and PM.
Compatibility with EMS 3.0 isn't needed anymore, and in fact has been
provided only when the EMS30 keyword is present in the profile.
However, checking for these I/O ports was still being done.  Now, we
skip around these checks unless EMS30 is specified which avoids the
problem with overlapping I/O ports.

At the same time, I deleted a test for load SWAT as to whether or not
we trap certain debugging interrupts in the VME SIRB.  This helps when
debugging on a VME-compatible CPU (i.e.  late model 486s and all
Pentiums and later) with non-load (i.e.  device) SWAT.

QMAX_IOP.ASM	Whenever the incoming I/O port is being checked in
		  our GP Fault handler, skip around EMS 3.0 I/O ports
		  unless the EMS30 keyword is specified.

QMAX_EVM.ASM	Skip check for load SWAT when deciding to trap
		  debugging interrupts in the VME SIRB.  Also, trap
		  INTs 02h and 03h as well.
