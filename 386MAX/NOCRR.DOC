Workaround Hardware Intel Overdrive Incompatibility

On some systems with an Intel Overdrive CPU (COMPAQ 466 XL comes to
mind), if we set the Cache Disable bit on the tail of a ROM, the
contents of the ROM can change out from underneath us.	COMPAQ says
this is an incompatibility between their system and the Intel CPU.

Our workaround is to define a new keyword (NOCRR) which when set
avoids setting the Cache Disable bit in these circumstances (say a 10K
ROM at C800-CA80, where we would set the Cache Dsiable bit on the 4KB
page at CA00).

MAKEFILE	Note dependency of QMAX_EVM.ASM and QMAX_MEM.ASM on
		  QMAX_CM4.INC.

386MAX		Document new keyword.

QMAX_CM4.INC	Define bit for new keyword.

QMAX_ARG.ASM	Place new keyword in parse table.

QMAX_EVM.ASM	If NOCRR in effect, don't set Cache Disable bit for
		  other RAM not on 4KB boundary.

QMAX_FCN.ASM	Define routine to process new keyword.

QMAX_MEM.ASM	In CHK_ALIGN, if we're aligning ROMs and NOCRR is in
		  effect, don't mark the ROM tail as other RAM.
