Fix Bug In Previous LOWSTK TWT

In an earlier TWT, I corrected a problem with overflowing the low DOS
stack by copying the entire low DOS data area from the original copy
in extended memory.  At the time I said that

"Because the low DOS stack (and the data below it) doesn't change over
the PM initialization code, we can refresh it from the pristine copy
in extended memory."

One case skipped by, though -- PnP initialization of a RM vector to
handle the DWCFGMG.SYS driver which enters RM through VM/VCPI and then
calls the RM code.  This TWT fixes that.

Also I checked all other references to DTE_DSLO, none of which occur
during PM initialization.

QMAX_EVM.ASM	Save the copy of the PnP RM entry point in extended
		  memory knowing that it'll be copied to low DOS
		  before we enter VM.
