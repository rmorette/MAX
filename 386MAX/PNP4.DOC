Emulate Additional PnP Functions

A new addition to the PnP spec has come out in the guise of a BIOS
Boot Specification from COMPAQ, Phoenix, and Intel which defines seven
new functions.	This TWT implements our emulation of those functions.

At the same time, I cleaned up the emulation code for the previous
functions so as to use an extension struc for the variable arguments
which are defined per function.

Also, these tests are included in ROMSRCH (and TESTPNP).


Common
------

PNP.INC 	Define equates for new functions.


386MAX
------

QMAX_EM2.ASM	Define emulation of new functions.


ROMSRCH
-------

FUNCS.ASM	Test new functions.
