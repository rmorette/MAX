Remove Dependency On EGA As Minimum Video Adapter

In CHECK_LINE, a routine common to 386LOAD.SYS, 386LOAD.COM, and
386UTIL.COM, we get the number of rows on the screen from a variable
(EGA_ROWS) in the BIOS data area.  On some systems where there is a
monochrome adapter only present, this variable isn't filled in and is
zero.

Whenever one of the above utilities displays a line to the screen, it
checks to see if the line count exceeds the number of lines on the
screen.  In this case, because this variable is zero, it constantly
displays the pause message of "Press any key to continue".

The fix is to assume there are 25 lines on the screen if the EGA_ROWS
value is zero.

UTIL_STR.ASM	If EGA_ROWS is zero, assume 25 lines.
