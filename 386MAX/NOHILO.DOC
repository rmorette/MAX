Don't Create .COM Files MAXHI/MAXLO/386MAX By Default

As we don't ship MAXHI.COM, MAXLO.COM, or 386MAX.COM any more, it
seems silly to create them each time we run NMAKE.  This change limits
creation of those files to when the keyword XUTIL is defined on the
NMAKE command line.

MAKEFILE	Surround all references to $(HINAME), $(LONAME), and
		  $(UTLNAME) with checks for XUTIL.
