The file (386MAX.VXD) contained within the zip file (NEWVXD.ZIP)
replaces the file of the same name in your QMAX 8 directory.  Look in
your CONFIG.SYS file and find the directory from which the file
386MAX.SYS is loaded, and copy the new VxD into that directory.

This new VxD fixes a bug which causes QMAX 8 to fail to load under
Win95 OSR2 and Win98.
