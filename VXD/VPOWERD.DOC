Workaround Bug In Win95's Internal VPOWERD Driver

Because of an alignment bug in the internal VPOWERD driver in Win95's
VMM32.VxD, we need to hook the _Allocate_Global_V86_Data_Area service
and promote the alignment for at least their calls to this service
from dword to para.  The VPOWERD code requests dword alignment, but
their use of the resulting data area actually requires para alignment.

We actually promote all calls with dword alignment to para alignment.

VMAX_SVM.ASM	Hook the _Allocate_Global_V86_Data_Area service.
		In our local handler, if dword alignment requested,
		  make it para.
