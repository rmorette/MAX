Fix Bug Clobbering Registers

When we run under Win95, there's a point at which we call some VMM
functions which clobber some registers near and dear to us.  Put on
more body armor.

VMAX_SVM.ASM	Insert more DOSMAX debug breakpoints.
		Label more DOXMAX debug breakpoints.
		In DOSMAX_DESTROYVM, protect us from W clobbering some
		  of our registers.
