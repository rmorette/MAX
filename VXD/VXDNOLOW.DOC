Delete Checks For Backfilled Systems

Because it causes more trouble than it solves, Tech Support would like
the checking for backfilled systems to be removed.  Although it's true
that Windows won't run in a backfilled system, there just aren't any
more of them around.  Moreover, there are a number of false positives
e.g. where a boot utility allocates memory from the top of low DOS and
the later relocates itself and re-adjusts the INT 12h value.
